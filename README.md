# fort-rpg

## This is an RPG written in the venerable Fortran language.

Surprisingly building and running a Fortran program on Linux is
super easy.

Assuming you are on any flavor of Linux, from the command line clone the repository, cd into it and run:

```
make
```

That's it!

### Now run it:

```
./rpg
```

### Next make changes!

Open and edit any of the .f90 files to see the code.
Even without knowing Fortran, it isn't hard to comprehend what is happening
and tweak the existing code.

Make some changes, make a pull request, and be a Fortran coder on GitHub!

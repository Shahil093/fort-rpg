Three available occupations:
Fighter
Sorceror
Dancer

Character starts by choosing their top two occupations
Roll 2d4+2 for ability for occupation 1
Roll 1d4+2 for ability for occupation 2
Roll 1d4 for ability for occupation 3

HP = sum of all ability
Starting money= ability of occupation 1 * 100

A "test" requires a 1d12 roll. If your ability is higher than that, success.

Leveling up:
make a roll for each occupation. If all three are higher, then each ability is +1.

Battle:
50% chance of ambush or preemptive attack

Roll a 1d12 against enemy's ability. Results:
+0, +1 roll 1d4 for damage
+2, +3 roll 1d4+2 for damage
+4 or above roll 2d4 for damage
